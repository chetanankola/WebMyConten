<h1>My understanding after Neha's explaination</h1>
So we have nodejs, which lets you write an application, on server, to be able to include all javascript..
and all you get back is pure html.. note that when you debug nodejs app you cannot run firebug.. since there
is no javascript included anywhere..<br><br>

mojito is a layer on top of nodejs. so that instead of nodejs app you can now write mojits which are mojito application
Whats the use? mojit lets you write apps with MVC framework... lets you configure where to deploy app..
lets you define apps and tests together...(Even QE can write a mojit inside your app.. to test your app)
What does an app mean? an app can be a simple thing like creating a webpage and say when you click on link
what happens etc...
<br><br>
so when an application is deployed.. its generally deployed on manhattan..thats like production place..
manhattan returns back a link..prod link.. which can be tested too..
<br><br>
before tat lets assume that i make an app and and there is  central repository.. that contains a central app called
<br><br>
Mojito_app_finance.
and assume many people are writing app into it.. say one app to populate the header of the page..
one app to populate the footer etc.. mojito also has another integration app that is like a frame or something
and lets you combine all components ...
<br><br>
so everyone checks in.. turns out even QE team mite check in their code to test the code..
QE mite write a mojito app to test or may be a maven based app to test the mojit application
a maven based test meaning.. i run a cmd say abc.java and it goes and checks the application link
and checks whats teh content for eG:
<br><br>
if ur mojit app is deployed at a link called http://famoushost:2342/header/index
then maven based test will hit this linka dn check for value say /body/h1tag/ check value..
<br><br>
Rememeber that a QE can write a test either using maven [ which is a java based test.. so we have
MSTL written on top of selenium? to test the link..it wont touch the code...!!]
<br><br>
<h1>HUDSON</h1>
So once a code is in some repository.. its checked in.. now one can test the code from
browser or write maven tests.. or write mojit tests.. whatevre..
<br><br>
hudsonpicks it up... and check if there are any jobs .
who fillsthe jobs in hudson? people who want to have their tests run submit jobs .. and also specify how their
tests are supposed to be run.. Wen Gu is the person who can tell more about this.. 
grasshopper is used to deploy apps on manhattan..
<br><br>
ScrewDriver is the next layer on top of hudson.. to which people will submit job which is just a
svn repo.. of their tests.. and it will know how to run..
<br><br>

what else?
