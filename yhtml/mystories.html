One of options I considered was to design an abstraction of test execution interface <br>
over different execution systems. Something extensible and generic that could be used for long term. <br>
Then Screwdriver would always generate the test run commandline based <br>
on the agreed abstraction of test execution and the standard implementation would come with Screwdriver.<br>
If the followings are test execution interface <br>

 1) run <options> unit <br>
 2) run <options> smoke <br>
 3) run <options> regression  <br>
 4) run <options> performance <br>

The standard implementation of run script would spit out the following actual commandline to run: <br>
 
 1) mojito unit test run commandline <br>
 2) maven/testng based test run commandline <br>
 3) jmeter test run commandline <br>
    </p>   
   </li>
   
   
   <li><p>As Mojito QE, we need test execution interface implementation. <p>
            Kinds of test run script implementation:
- unit tests
- secondard tests
- regression tests
- performance tests
